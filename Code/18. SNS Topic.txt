Create an SNS Topic with email subscription. The lambda function - AuditTableScannerFn - publishes messages into this topic.
This is the email where the automatic notifications (for both SUCCESS - counts match across layers - and FAILURE - counts do not match across layers - scenarios are sent).
We can coose to have 2 different topics / 2 different emails as well - one for SUCCESS scenarios and another for FAILURE scenarios.
