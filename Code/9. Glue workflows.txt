We have 3 workflows:

1. The main "orders-workflow" has all the landing / staging area crawlers, audit table loads and the landing to staging transformation job.
The trigger type for this workflow is an EventBridge Event -> orders-infinite-loop-rule
You can configure the "Number of Events" after which the trigger will start or the "Time delay" after which the trigger will start.
i.e. you can start the workflow after you receive 100 files or after a delay of 300 seconds after the first file arrival -> whichever is earlier.
This could be useful if we want to trigger based on the data files but we will be triggering based on a "batch completion file". 
So we will leave the Number of events and Time delay with default values.

If you do not wwant to run your workflow continuously but only based on the arrival of a batch-completion-file, use the EventBridge Event -> orders-eventbridge-rule.


2. The "orders-enable-infinite-loop-rule-workflow" has a SCHEDULE based trigger that start at 9:15 AM on all weekdays (Mon - Fri).
The only job in this workflow is the Glue Python Shell job - orders_rule_enable.

3. The "orders-disable-infinite-loop-rule-workflow" has a SCHEDULE based trigger that start at 9:00 AM on all weekdays + Sat.
The only job in this workflow is the Glue Python Shell job - orders_rule_disable.

So, effectively the main workflow runs continuously on all weekdays from 9:15 AM to next day 9:00 AM.
The workflow will not start automatically at 9:15 AM. When the first file arrives at or after 9:15 AM, the workflow will start and then it will be a continuous loop.
